The races are:<br />\r\n							<span id=\"more-4983\"></span><br />\r\n							<strong>Human:</strong> Humans are very adaptable and can excel in all professions. Humans gain experience points 10% faster.</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Minotaur:</strong> Minotaurs are bulky, simple and quick to anger. Their incredible stubborness is tolerated by others only because of their incredible prowess in combat. Minotaurs have the following modifiers to attributes: Strength +5, Dexterity -4, Vitality +4, Willpower -3. Minotaurs are always hungry and their food consumption rate is 25% higher than normal.</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Lizardman:</strong> Lizardmen are a social outcast and are mistrusted by other races because of their capricious and deceitful nature. What they lack in social skills they greatly make up for in stealth and dexterity. Lizardmen have Dexterity +2 and Willpower -2. In addition their thick scales protect them from the elements (Resist All +25%).</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Insectoid:</strong> Insectoid&#8217;s thoughts are completely alien to other races. Insectoids come in many shapes and sizes but most often their bodies are covered with a thick shell. Their knowledge of the arcane is unrivaled. Insectoids have Strength +1, Dexterity -2, Vitality -1 and Willpower +2. In addition their hard shell protects them from being wounded (-50% chance of getting a body part injured).</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Ratling:</strong> Ratlings may seem weak and disease ridden on the surface, but they are actually one of the most adaptable and hardy creatures in the world. Ratlings are hoarders by nature (Max Load +15kg) and greatly enjoy fiddling with mechanical contraptions. Ratlings have Strength -4, Dexterity +2 and Evasion +2. Ratlings are immune to effects of diseases.</p>\r\n							<p>Each race has special traits that can be chosen in character creation. For example, some Lizardmen have Fast Metabolism which makes them regenerate health and energy 30% faster while some Lizardmen have even thicker scales which makes them very protected against elemental damage (additional +25% bonus to resistances).</p>\r\n							<p>Classes in Grimrock 2 are more flexible than in Grimrock 1. The classes give the characters a starting point and nudge towards a path without forcing it upon them. Every class can advance in the 16 available skills as they like. For example, nothing is stopping your Fighter to learn some magic as long as you advance your Fighter in the spell casting skills.</p>\r\n							<p>The classes determine your character&#8217;s health and energy and special abilities. The classes are:</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Alchemist:</strong> Alchemists are the masters of potion brewing. Herbs automatically grow in the alchemist&#8217;s inventory during his journey on the island. Alchemists are also proficient with firearms (firearms have 50% less chance to malfunction).</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Barbarian:</strong> Barbarians do not care about finesse in combat. Instead they rely on raw power and speed. Barbarians Strength is increased by 1 for every level they gain. Barbarians start with the largest amount of health points of all classes and their health grows rapidly as they gain levels.</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Battle Mage:</strong> Battle Mages are comfortable with fighting in the front row as well as blasting with spells from the back row. They gain moderate amount of health and energy at 1st level. Like Wizards they are natural spellcasters and can cast spells with their bare hands. In addition, when a Battle Mage is equipped with a staff they gain bonuses to their defense.</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Fighter:</strong> Fighters are masters of close combat. They are great at using special attacks of melee weapons (special attacks with melee weapons take half the time to build up and cost 25% less energy).</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Knight:</strong> Knights believe that good preparation is the key to triumph in combat. Knight&#8217;s Protection value increase by 1 point per level and they are masters of using armor (weight of equipped armor is reduced by 50% and Evasion bonus of equipped shields is increased by 50%).</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Rogue:</strong> Rogues are stealthy warrior who usually fight with ranged weapons or light melee weapons. When dual wielding they suffer only 25% penalty to weapon damage (normally 40%). Also their chance of scoring a critical hit with missile or throwing weapons is increased by 1% per level.</p>\r\n							<p><strong>Wizard:</strong> Wizards are natural spellcasters who can cast spells with bare hands. For added effect they sometimes use enchanted staves and orbs to enhance their spellcasting abilities. Wizards have low health but high energy. They also get +2 bonus to their Willpower.</p>\r\n							<p>In addition there is a <em>secret eighth class</em>. You have to wait until Wednesday to find out yourself what it is. It is meant for advanced players and changes a core aspect of the game in a radical way. </p>\r\n							<p>Your character can also be customized by picking two traits and leveling up two skills of your choise (three if you have the Skilled trait). You can also pick your portrait from the 48 beautiful portraits available. If you can&#8217;t make up your mind about some aspect of character creation you can also let the fate decide: name, race, class, attribute scores, skills and traits can all be randomized if you so prefer.

The first thing I want to say is, big thanks for the fantastic feedback on the Pre-Order Trailer! You guys truly deserve a full blown sequel and we are going to squeeze our best to deliver that for you on October 15th!</p>\r\n							<p>These are the final days before we freeze content creation for the game and focus entirely on bug fixing and other release related technicalities. In the mean while, we animators have finally decided to break the silence and expose some of the black magic we use in our animation for Legend of Grimrock 2. Well, to be honest, actually there is nothing too sophisticated, just bare to the bone simple and robust stuff. But in case you have been wondering what&#8217;s going on in the animation department of the mysterious and secluded Isle of Nex, this is your chance to sneak in. Please, let me show you around!<br />\r\n							&nbsp;<br />\r\n							<div style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://grimrock.net/images/monster_rigs.gif\" width=\"750\" height=\"344\" alt=\"Monster Rigs Variation\" class /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Monster Rigs Variation</p></div><br />\r\n							<span id=\"more-4684\"></span>\r\n							<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n							The first thing you are going to notice in our tour is that we animate a wide selection of very distinctive monsters for Legend of Grimrock 2, all the way from mellow jelly blobs to disgusting flying eyes to giant ogres, as seen in the image above. As you can imagine, there is no one rig we can share with all these totally distinctive monsters in the game, so every monster needs a unique custom rig. In case you are not familiar with what a rig is, I would describe it as a structure inside a character that defines the way it is animated and deformed, just like the bone and muscle structure inside our bodies. The rigs of Grimrock are built fairly simply because each one is dedicated for a specific monster, which usually means only about 10-20 clips of animation, although some monsters may have over 30 different clips. The reasoning for such quick and simple rigs is that there is no advantage in putting too much effort in building complicated rigs, only to be used for a few animation clips. It takes somewhere from 3-10 days to animate all the needed clips for a monster, depending on the complexity of the monster. So spending a week only on building the rig would double the development time per monster, which would result in fewer monsters in the game. Another good reason for using quick and simple rigs is agility in the development process. The simpler the rigs, the easier it is to modify or completely rebuild them and get back to animation as soon as possible. This approach is proving fruitful especially in a small indie studio.</p>\r\n							<p>Technically the rigs are built of three layers that can be seen in the animated GIF below. Oh, my apologies, may I introduce you to one of the mummies of Legend of Grimrock 2! This friendly individual is always eager to give a hand <img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Well, he may not totally creep you out now, but I promise you that these walkers will make you scream at some point of the game, trust me <img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br />\r\n							&nbsp;<br />\r\n							<div id=\"attachment_4686\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rig_structure.gif\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rig_structure.gif\" alt=\"Rig structure breakdown\" title=\"rig_structure_breakdown\" width=\"750\" height=\"506\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4686\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rig structure breakdown</p></div>\r\n							<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n							Lets open the hood and see what the mummy&#8217;s rig looks like. The first mummy, marked by the letter <strong>A</strong>, shows the animated monster in idle mode. Mummy <strong>B</strong> shows the three layers of rigs working together. Mummy <strong>C</strong> shows the blue rig, which is the basic level that handles all the inverse kinematics (IK) and the positioning of the joints. IK may sound to some of you like vocabulary from the old ages of classic sci-fi jargon, but for us animators it&#8217;s actually pure magic straight from heaven. It&#8217;s a built-in system in animation software that enables to easily pose the limbs of a character simply by positioning the end of a limb instead of painstakingly positioning every part of it. Mummy <strong>D</strong> shows the red rig, which we use to actually keyframe the monster. We position most of those 25 controllers for every key pose the mummy does in the animation clip. A typical clip in Grimrock would have about 30 frames (one second of animation) and about 6-10 poses, which will sum up as around a minimum of 150 positioning of controllers through the short animation clip. Please observe the image below to see an example of the key poses of the walk clip of our handy friend.<br />\r\n							&nbsp;<br />\r\n							<div id=\"attachment_4857\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mummy_Walk_Key_Poses_750px.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mummy_Walk_Key_Poses_750px.jpg\" alt=\"Mummy walk key poses\" width=\"750\" height=\"424\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4857\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mummy Walk Key Poses</p></div>\r\n							<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n							In practice these poses are iterated over and over many times until the movement of the monster is perfect. So, one could say that it takes thousands of keyframed positions to create a single one second long final animation clip. For efficiency reasons the rigs are built with the minimum controllers required to create the needed poses. The idea is that less controllers means less keyframes and better productivity. However, too few controllers will make it a struggle to pose a character correctly. The idea is that the controller rig needs to be simple, but convenient to use.</p>\r\n							<p>The last mummy marked by the letter <strong>E</strong> in the rig breakdown image shows the deformation rig that gets exported to the game engine. This rig is separate for three reasons. 1st reason is that it is easier to handle what is exported when the rig is completely separate. It should be noted that it is important to avoid exporting unnecessary items to the game engine, not to disturb  performance. 2nd reason is that it enables us to use different animation controller rigs for different clips, if needed. This way we can freely make custom modifications to the controller rig (red) for any clip, while driving the same deformation rig (multi color) that absolutely needs to be identical in all animation clips in the game. Finally, the 3rd reason is that a separate deformation rig enables us to have a different hierarchy in the controller and deformation rigs, which is quite often the case. For example, sometimes the hand&#8217;s controllers need to be parented to the root of the rig, so the hands stay in place when the torso is posed. However, in the game, the hand&#8217;s deformers must be parented to the arms in order to minimize jiggle. Our simple solution is to have the controller rig drive a completely separate deformer rig using constrains.</p>\r\n							<p>So there you have it, that&#8217;s how we construct our rigs. This system is simple and flexible for all of our needs. The rigs are not powered by any code or scripts. Everything is native out-of-the-box simple Softimage methods. Nothing fancy. The best thing I like about this approach is that it gives the animator independence and confidence that he is not dependent on a team of experts to handle the rigs. I feel that an animator should know his rigs and when needed, make some tweaks under the hood right on the spot. The same way a good sports car driver need to know a certain level of automobile mechanics in order to really push his performance to the limits. This kind of approach is especially helpful for a team player in a small indie studio with no dedicated technical art experts.</p>\r\n							<p>And lastly, at the peak of our tour, our natural talent animator Jyri Leppänen shall show you below a quick demonstration of what it looks like when a few of the Mummy&#8217;s animation clips that he animated for you are stitched together.</p>\r\n							<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fgbFb4aU20o\"></iframe>\r\n							<p>And if for some incomprehensible reason you have missed the Pre-Order Trailer, check it out below and <a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/buy/#log2\"  title=\"pre-order\">pre-order</a> now!</p>\r\n							<p>Buy the way, can you spot the Mummy?<br />\r\n							<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ex8kDMKnLaE?list=PLgGBNfq4Z8KLBKS5QHVn4zxNr0aq5aUhk\"></iframe>'),(15,2,'Legend of Grimrock 2 Key Art Revealed','http://www.grimrock.net/2014/09/11/legend-of-grimrock-2-key-art-revealed/','Juho Salila','2014-09-11 00:00:00','<p><a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/log2_keyart_1920x1080.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/log2_keyart_1920x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"log2_keyart_1920x1080\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4750\" /></a><br />\r\n							&nbsp;<br />\r\n							There is a saying that one shouldn&#8217;t judge book by its cover. But hey, let&#8217;s be honest, everyone checks the cover first ;). That means that whether it&#8217;s a book cover, a movie poster or game box art, the cover is really important piece of the first impression you get from a new product. Even though LoG2 probably won&#8217;t be published in physical form, it still needs &#8220;box art&#8221; that will be used everywhere from web page, digital marketplace and game reviews to desktop backgrounds. In game business box art is also sometimes called key art. That means that the one image should reflect pretty much the whole game, its mood, story, setting, characters and on top of it all it needs to look really good to stand out of thousands of other images. Not so easy huh? The key art was finished about a half a year ago, so it&#8217;s about time to let it see the day light. </p>\r\n							<p><span id=\"more-4349\"></span></p>\r\n							<p>We started planning the key art when we got the LoG2 setting finally settled down and felt certain that it was the direction we wanted to go. In our case the key art helped us to focus on the chosen theme and gave us a good vibe and direction to follow. As the game is very oldschool flavored, I wanted it to be reflected in the key art also. So I started thinking of the things and mood we wanted to portray. It took some iterations of sketching to get to the core of what we were after. I didn&#8217;t want to use any photo based techniques or 3d rendered assets. What I had in mind, was the book covers that got me interested in fantasy art and painting in the first place: Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson (r.i.p) and Brom. They are my all time greatest heroes and I wanted to give my humble tribute to their art, like Grimrock gives to games of that era. In perfect world I would&#8217;ve wanted to do the image in oil paints, but after reality check, the digital medium was the only logical choice. It has many benefits and one doesn&#8217;t have to wait for the pixels to dry. I tried to keep a painterly feel to the image and didn&#8217;t use &#8220;too perfect&#8221; tools that Photoshop offers.<br />\r\n							<a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sketch_vertical.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sketch_vertical.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"sketch_vertical\" width=\"999\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-4374\" /></a><br />\r\n							I started sketching with the traditional book cover or poster aspect ration and then expanded the sketches I liked to horizontal format. Legend of Grimrock 2 will be on a couple of different digital stores that all have their own graphical styles. Some are leaned more towards horizontal images and some have more traditional vertical images. The different aspect ratios also gave some challenges to the composition of the image. I wanted to try to come up with an image that would work well with both horizontal and vertical images.<br />\r\n							<a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sketch_horizontal.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sketch_horizontal.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"sketch_horizontal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"574\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-4373\" /></a></p>\r\n							<p><a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/key_art_aspect_ratios.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/key_art_aspect_ratios.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"key_art_aspect_ratios\" width=\"1200\" height=\"882\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4706\" /></a><br />\r\n							The painting took close to five full packed days to complete. It&#8217;s painted in Photoshop around 6500 pixels wide to help the brushes work better, but still maintain good enough computer performance. The image was a really fun little project to complete and we hope you guys also like it. We feel that it captures the feeling of LoG2 pretty well. I also recorded some painting stages to better illustrate how the image came together. Now go on and check out the big version of the final image.<br />\r\n							<a href=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stages.gif\" ><img src=\"http://www.grimrock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stages.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"stages\" width=\"700\" height=\"517\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-4350\" /></a><br />\r\n							&nbsp;<br />\r\n							Quick word about the current development status. We&#8217;re busy polishing the game based on the great feedback we are getting from the beta testers. I just completed the game the other day clocking about 22 hours of playtime with 48/74 of the current secrets, even though I knew the solutions to the puzzles of the first quarter of the game. So there should be plenty of exploring to finish the game 100%. In other news, Petri has been busting his ass off and he&#8217;s managed to optimize the game roughly 40% faster. So now the game doesn&#8217;t necessarily need super highend game rig to play. But I have to say that the minimum system requirements are going to go up a bit compared to LoG1. Stay tuned, next week is going to be exciting ;). </p>'),(16,3,'Issue #3 - Better Late than Never','http://neovim.org/news/2014/sept/','Thiago de Arruda','2014-09-06 00:00:00','<p>Welcome to the third (and delayed) newsletter for Neovim, the project that aims to overhaul the Vim codebase.</p>\r\n							<p>The next newsletter will be coming out near the beginning of November. It has changed to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neovim/status/504448350221901824\">every other month</a> as to not overload any sensitive Neovim lovers with too much staggering awe.</p>\r\n							<h2>General News</h2>\r\n							<h3>Over 1,000 Issues</h3>\r\n							<p>The Issue tracker on GitHub now has over 1,000 issues/pull requests. The lucky <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1000\">1000th pull request</a> was opened shortly before August.</p>\r\n							<h3>Documentation Update</h3>\r\n							<p>As mentioned in last July’s newsletter, the documentation has successfully been moved to <a href=\"http://neovim.org/doc/\">neovim.org/doc/</a>.</p>\r\n							<p>It features some general documenation links as well as some more specific reports directed towards developers and contributors. These reports have already <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/985\">helped developers</a> contribute and improve the codebase.</p>\r\n							<h2>Development News</h2>\r\n							<p>In no particular order, here are the top stories in the last two months.</p>\r\n							<h3>Implementing <code>system()</code> with Pipes</h3>\r\n							<p>This issue was mentioned in the <a href=\"http://neovim.org/news/2014/june/\">June newsletter</a> on things that were yet to come.</p>\r\n							<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aktau\">@aktau</a> has <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/978\">finished implementing</a> the VimL <code>system()</code> function to use pipes and the job system instead of redirecting to temporary files. The change provides a nice speed boost and avoids some permission issues (mainly affecting Windows, which is not supported yet).</p>\r\n							<p>The slowness of the old implementation of <code>system()</code> was especially noticeable when the called process had large output. An example of this is: <code>system(\'cat largefile\')</code>.</p>\r\n							<h4>Note</h4>\r\n							<blockquote>\r\n								<p>There has been one bug report concerning the new <code>system()</code> code: it doesn’t work well with the <a href=\"https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta\">Selecta</a> plugin as described <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1044\">here</a>.</p>\r\n							</blockquote>\r\n							<h3>More Precise Profiling</h3>\r\n							  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/aktau\">@aktau</a> leveraged <a href=\"https://github.com/joyent/libuv\">libuv’s</a> ability to provide a high resolution\r\n							  clock on many systems to improve Neovim’s profiling capability with <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/839\">this pull\r\n							  request</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n							  <p>The previous implementation was using <code>gettimeofday()</code>.
