						<h2><a href="http://www.grimrock.net/2014/10/22/grimrock-2-update-2-1-13/">Grimrock 2 Update 2.1.13</a></h2>
						<div class="author">by <b>Petri HÃ¤kkinen</b> (Legend of Grimrock)</div>
						<div>
							<p>We have just released a patch that updates Legend of Grimrock 2 to version 2.1.13. The patch fixes multiple issues, including some crash bugs, so it&#8217;s recommended that everybody updates to the latest version.</p>
							<p><strong>Steam version:</strong> the game should automatically update soon. If the game does not update in a few hours, restarting the Steam client should help.</p>
							<p><strong>Standalone version:</strong> if you are playing the standalone version, please <a href="http://grimrock.net/patch/grimrock2_2_1_9_to_2_1_13_patch.exe" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://grimrock.net/patch/grimrock2_2_1_9_to_2_1_13_patch.exe']);">download the patch</a> that updates the game installed on your computer. </p>
							<p><strong>GOG version:</strong> The patch also works with GOG installations but there is a slight kink. When a dialog appears saying that an existing installation can not be found and the patcher asks &#8220;Abort Installation?&#8221;, select No. You have to then navigate to the installation location of your GOG version of Legend of Grimrock 2.<br />
							<span id="more-5078"></span><br />
							We have sent the patched version to GOG and Humble Store and it will take some for them to process and make the new version available through their channels.</p>

							&#8211; bug fix: some map graphics are not shown on the automap after loading a save game<br />
							&#8211; bug fix: loading certain save games can sometimes crash with &#8220;inflate failed &#8211; ran out of available bytes&#8221; error<br />
