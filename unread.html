						<h2><a href="http://neovim.org/news/2014/sept/">Issue #3 - Better Late than Never</a></h2>
						<div class="author">by <b>Thiago de Arruda</b> (Neovim)</div>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Welcome to the third (and delayed) newsletter for Neovim, the project that aims to overhaul the Vim codebase.</p>
							<p>The next newsletter will be coming out near the beginning of November. It has changed to be <a href="https://twitter.com/Neovim/status/504448350221901824">every other month</a> as to not overload any sensitive Neovim lovers with too much staggering awe.</p>
							<h2>General News</h2>
							<h3>Over 1,000 Issues</h3>
							<p>The Issue tracker on GitHub now has over 1,000 issues/pull requests. The lucky <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1000">1000th pull request</a> was opened shortly before August.</p>
							<h3>Documentation Update</h3>
							<p>As mentioned in last July’s newsletter, the documentation has successfully been moved to <a href="http://neovim.org/doc/">neovim.org/doc/</a>.</p>
							<p>It features some general documenation links as well as some more specific reports directed towards developers and contributors. These reports have already <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/985">helped developers</a> contribute and improve the codebase.</p>
							<h2>Development News</h2>
							<p>In no particular order, here are the top stories in the last two months.</p>
							<h3>Implementing <code>system()</code> with Pipes</h3>
							<p>This issue was mentioned in the <a href="http://neovim.org/news/2014/june/">June newsletter</a> on things that were yet to come.</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/aktau">@aktau</a> has <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/978">finished implementing</a> the VimL <code>system()</code> function to use pipes and the job system instead of redirecting to temporary files. The change provides a nice speed boost and avoids some permission issues (mainly affecting Windows, which is not supported yet).</p>
							<p>The slowness of the old implementation of <code>system()</code> was especially noticeable when the called process had large output. An example of this is: <code>system('cat largefile')</code>.</p>
							<h4>Note</h4>
							<blockquote>
								<p>There has been one bug report concerning the new <code>system()</code> code: it doesn’t work well with the <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta">Selecta</a> plugin as described <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1044">here</a>.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<h3>More Precise Profiling</h3>
							  <p><a href="https://github.com/aktau">@aktau</a> leveraged <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">libuv’s</a> ability to provide a high resolution
							  clock on many systems to improve Neovim’s profiling capability with <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/839">this pull
							  request</a>.</p>

							  <p>The previous implementation was using <code>gettimeofday()</code>. This was a blocker in
							  getting Neovim to run on Windows (as detailed in the previous section) as this
							  function wasn’t supported in Windows.</p>

							  <p>For more info on profiling in Vim, just run <code>:help profiling</code>.</p>

							  <h3>Dropping of MoonScript</h3>

							  <p>During the start of of the project, the <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/207">MoonScript vs Lua
							  debate</a> was a widely discussed one.</p>

							  <p><a href="http://moonscript.org/">MoonScript</a> (a language that compiles to Lua) was chosen to be
							  the language for unit tests. After updating the unit test library,
							  <a href="http://olivinelabs.com/busted/">Busted</a>, some unit tests <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1098#issuecomment-53942512">were failing</a>.</p>

							  <p>Thus it was <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1098">decided</a> to drop the dependency to simplify
							  the tests and remove a layer of abstraction. <a href="https://github.com/tarruda">@tarruda</a> made the <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1128">accompanying
							  changes and pull request</a>.</p>

							  <h3>Msgpack RPC</h3>

							  <p><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1118">Discussion arose</a> regarding how Neovim wasn’t fully
							  compliant with the <a href="https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md">specification of msgpack-rpc</a>.</p>

							  <p>In the last few weeks, <a href="https://github.com/tarruda">@tarruda</a> has <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1121">completed the
							  implementation</a> to fully support the specification.</p>

							  <p>He also has been working on <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1130">upgrading</a> the use of msgpack to the
							  latest version, 2.0, which should be merged soon.</p>

							  <h3>Python Client</h3>

							  <p>In the first newsletter, a <a href="https://github.com/neovim/python-client">Python client</a> was first discussed.
							  Since then, <a href="https://github.com/tarruda">@tarruda</a> has <a href="https://github.com/neovim/python-client/pull/17">refactored it</a> for various
							  improvements.</p>

							  <h3>Go Client</h3>

							  <p><a href="https://github.com/myitcv">@myitcv</a> has made a <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1136">proposal for adding Go integration</a> in a
							  similar way that the Python integration works. The proposal also touches on
							  being language agnostic.</p>

							  <p>Although too copious to detail here, the link above also includes more details
							  on implementation and discussion regarding that.</p>

							  <h3>More Code Removal</h3>

							  <p>More code that was either dead or for unsupported legacy systems was removed in
							  two different pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/814">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1006">2</a>).</p>

							  <p>The systems that still had code lingering included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_IRIS">SGI IRIS</a>,
							  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">BeOS</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.</p>

							  <h3>Cross Platform Temporary Filenames</h3>

							  <p>The function to create temporary files in Neovim needed features that weren’t in
							  <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">libuv</a>.</p>

							  <p><a href="https://github.com/Hinidu">@Hinidu</a>, one of Neovim’s contributors, <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1368">sent a pull request</a> to
							  libuv to add a new function, <code>uv_fs_mkdtemp</code>. The changes (now part of libuv
							  <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv/commit/ffe24f955032d060968ea0289af365006afed55e">version 0.11.27</a>) are being <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1034">used by Neovim</a> to provide
							  temporary file/directory creation and the changes work across platforms.</p>

							  <p>Because the cross-plaform code has been contributed to libuv, all libuv-based
							  projects can benefit from the changes.</p>

							  <h3>First Bounty Claimed!</h3>

							  <p>Back on April 9th, the <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/501">first bounty</a> on <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/teams/neovim">Neovim’s
							  Bountysource</a> was created. The request was to port an existing
							  patch that was written by Christian Brabandt from Vim to Neovim. The patch gives
							  a <code>breakindent</code> option that will match the indentation when a line is wrapped.</p>

							  <p><a href="https://github.com/fmoralesc">@fmoralesc</a> created a <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/691">pull request</a> to claim the bounty. A bit of
							  discussion took place and some revisions were made. Since then they have been
							  merged into the master branch and <a href="https://github.com/fmoralesc">@fmoralesc</a> has been awarded the bounty!</p>

							  <h3>More Unit Tests</h3>

							  <p><a href="https://github.com/war1025">@war1025</a> has <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/904">added unit tests</a> for two existing files:
							  <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/buffer.c">buffer.c</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/fileio.c">fileio.c</a>. Adding more unit test
							  coverage to the code as it is refactored is part of the goal of Neovim.</p>

							  <h3>Core Service Providers</h3>

							  <p><a href="https://github.com/tarruda">@tarruda</a> made a <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/895">pull request</a> that is exposing some of Neovim’s core
							  functionality through the msgpack API.</p>

							  <p>While still volatile as it evolves, this core functionality includes:</p>

							  <ul>
							    <li><a href="https://github.com/tarruda/neovim/commit/8a091e7f5c58a27fb3af1de76284430e812c95b5">Support functions for external interpreters</a></li>
								  <li><a href="https://github.com/tarruda/neovim/commit/fba1d3b50f34a4e755bee8fa5dcc192efef202d8">Accessing/changing the clipboard registers</a></li>
								    <li><a href="https://github.com/tarruda/neovim/commit/486c8e37c17e4aa89fa9ef7e0c682b659a5a8a82">More Python support</a></li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Embeddability Progress</h3>

									<p><a href="https://github.com/tarruda">@tarruda</a> has <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1060">added a <code>--embedded-mode</code></a> flag which will allow another
									program to start Neovim in the background and use it as a headless instance.</p>

									<p>Technically, it uses <a href="https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc">msgpack-rpc</a> to talk with the client using
									stdin and stdout.</p>

									<h3>Windows Progress</h3>

									<p>Neovim has successfully been compiled in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh386302.aspx">Microsoft Visual C++</a> as
									well as using <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, in <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/696">this issue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/810">this
									one</a> respectively.</p>

						<div class="author">by <b>Laurent Carlier</b> (Arch Linux)</div>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The new version comes with the following changes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>X is now rootless with the help of systemd-logind, this also means that it must be launched from the same virtual terminal as was used to log in, redirecting stderr also breaks rootless login. The old root execution behavior can be restored through the Xorg.wrap config file (man xorg.wrap). Please note that launching X through a login-manager (gdm, kdm, ...) doesn't yet provide rootless access.</p></li>
								<li><p>The default configuration files are now in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d, all host configurations are still taking place in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory. Please note that files 10-evdev.conf and 10-quirks.conf in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d could be renamed with .pacsave suffix, which could break your configuration, then just rename them and remove the .pacsave suffix.</p></li>
								<li><p>Better glamor accelerated rendering, deprecating <code>glamor-egl</code> package.</p></li>
								<li><p>A new package <code>xorg-server-xwayland</code> that allows running X applications inside a wayland session.</p></li>
								<li><p>The <code>xf86-video-intel</code> package doesn't provide dri3 support anymore because of multiple rendering bugs.</p></li>
